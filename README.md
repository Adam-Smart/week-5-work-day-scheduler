# week-5-work-day-scheduler

## Description

This website is a useful and handy tool that lets you keep track of the user's workday schedule. It allows the user to keep track of everything that they have to achieve for the day
and it does this by allowing the user to input their own task they have for each hour of the workday from 9 am till 5 pm. Once the user has added their tasks for the day they can click on the save button which saves their required task at the correct hour into the local storage allowing them to close the website and re-open it at any time and will continue to display their tasks. The scheduler has been color coded so the user can easily identify whether the hour was in the past (grey), present (red), or the future (green). It does this by using dayjs which checks for the hour and applies the corresponding class for past, present, and future. Dayjs also allows for an included current date at the top of the page.
